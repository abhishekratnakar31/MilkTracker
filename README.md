## Description
Milk Tracker is a blockchain-based application designed to bring transparency and immutability to the milk supply chain. It allows dairy farms to record milk batches directly onto the Flare network (Coston2 testnet). Each batch record includes the source farm's identity, the quantity of milk produced, and a timestamp, ensuring a verifiable history of production.

## Features
Traditional dairy supply chains struggle with:
- Lack of transparency  
- Difficulty auditing production logs  
- Inconsistent or forged records  
- No unified system to verify timelines or quantities  

Consumers, regulators, and distributors often rely on trust instead of verifiable data.

### The Solution  
MilkTracker anchors every batch entry on a public blockchain, ensuring complete transparency and trust.

**How it helps:**

#### For Farms  
- Easily register each batch as soon as it's produced  
- Create an immutable history of output volumes  

#### For Distributors  
- Verify the authenticity of milk sources instantly  
- Reduce fraud and maintain better inventory control  

#### For Consumers  
- Access transparent proof of product origin  
- Confirm freshness through immutable timestamps  

#### For Auditors  
- Full traceability for compliance and quality checks  
- Independent verification with no need for intermediaries

MilkTracker transforms dairy tracking from an opaque process into an open, verifiable, and trustworthy system powered by blockchain technology.
